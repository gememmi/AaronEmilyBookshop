Welcome to our bookshop app! Feel free to look around at our eclectic, curated selection of books, including some of the owners most favorites.
Users can use the search bar to filter through our rendered objects and return matches based on author, title, or genre. 
Users can click on the image of each rendered object to change the image to the book's back cover and render a list of additional information including the number of pages, the first publishing year, and the book's genre.
When the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, their selected book title will be added to their user cart and the button text will change to "Remove from Cart". When the user clicks on button again, the text will change back and the book title will be removed from their cart. 


On our homepage, you will find the complete collection.
